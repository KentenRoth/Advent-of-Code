# Advent-of-Code

I am going to go back and do some of the older advent of code challenges and move all the code that I do have over to this repo.

I rarely make it past the first week or so in Advent of code because I don't use or do much with aalgorithms. Algorithms are always on my list of things I want to learn, it's just something that I have not done. It seems I always start projects, or work on something else and they get put on the back burner.
