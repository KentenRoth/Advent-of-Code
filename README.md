# Advent-of-Code

I am going to go back and do some of the older advent of code challenges and move all the code that I do have over to this repo.

I rarely make it past the first week or so in Advent of code because I don't use or do much with aalgorithms. Algorithms are always on my list of things I want to learn, it's just something that I have not done. It seems I always start projects, or work on something else and they get put on the back burner.

## Day 1
Part 1 Day 1 I didn't have many stuggles.  Switches wasn't something I use much of, so I was wanting to do a little practice with that.
I struggled a lot on Part 2.  I was wanting to stick with the switch, and using the TurnLeft and TurnRight methods, but I could not figure out what I was doing wrong, and was unable to get it working correctly.  After working on it for a few days I decided to look into other ways of doing it. I noticed several people using a foreach and doing all of the logic there, so that was the way I moved.  One thing I did learn by reading other peoples code, was that Math.Abs would turn a negative number into a positive.

I am going to be attempting Advent of Code this year with C#.  The goal is to work through the problem, get the correct answer, and then refactor.  I will be avoiding the use of copilot until the refacotring portion.  I will use copilot to help refactor, then using what changes to explore different things that I did not know about within the language.
